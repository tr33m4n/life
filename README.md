# life

A very basic Conway's Game of Life implementation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life built in PHP.

## Make sure you're environment is running PHP 8+ before executing

To run:
```shell
php ./run
```
If you're feeling adventurous you can pass it some X and Y parameters, eg:
```shell
php ./run -x 50 -y 50
```
However, no guarantee on whether it will work or not! This was mainly built for my own learning to get to grips with the
new features of PHP 8
